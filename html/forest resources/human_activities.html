        <h1><b>FOREST <i>RESOUCES</i></b>
        <br>Be Green. Stay Green</h1>
        <p><h4>Human Activities</h4>
            by <i>Malay, Saroj, Mohd Husaifa</i>
                <p>1. Human activities have a significant impact on forest resources, often leading to deforestation and degradation. One major culprit is logging, where trees are cut down for timber, paper, and other wood products. This not only reduces the number of trees but also disrupts ecosystems and habitats.
                <p>2. Agriculture also plays a role, as forests are sometimes cleared to make way for crops or grazing land. The use of slash-and-burn techniques in agriculture can lead to widespread destruction. Additionally, urbanization and infrastructure development can fragment forests, isolating populations of plants and animals and disrupting their natural dynamics.
                <p>3. Human activities also contribute to pollution, which can harm forest ecosystems. Industrial emissions, agricultural runoff, and improper waste disposal all introduce pollutants into the air and water, impacting the health of forests.
                <p>4. It's crucial for us to find sustainable ways to coexist with forests, balancing human needs with the preservation of these vital ecosystems. Conservation efforts, responsible resource management, and sustainable practices can help mitigate the negative impact of human activities on forest resources.
