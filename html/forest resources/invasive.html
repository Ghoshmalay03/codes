        <p><b>Invasive species can have detrimental effects on forest resources by disrupting the balance of ecosystems and outcompeting native flora and fauna. Here are some ways in which invasive species impact forests:</b>
            <br><br>1. <b>Competition for Resources</b>: Invasive plants often compete aggressively with native vegetation for sunlight, water, and nutrients. This competition can lead to a decline in native plant species, affecting the overall biodiversity and ecosystem health.
            <br>2. <b>Altered Ecosystem Structure</b>: Invasive species can change the composition and structure of forest ecosystems. They may replace native plants, which can, in turn, affect the animals that rely on those plants for food and shelter.
            <br>3. <b>Disruption of Ecological Processes</b>: Invasive species may disrupt natural ecological processes, such as nutrient cycling and seed dispersal. This can have cascading effects on the entire ecosystem, affecting both plant and animal species.
            <br>4. <b>Increased Wildfire Risk</b>: Some invasive plant species are more flammable than native vegetation, increasing the risk of wildfires. This poses a threat to the overall health of the forest and can lead to the loss of valuable timber and other resources.
            <br>5. <b>Disease Transmission</b>: Invasive species can introduce new diseases to native plants and animals that may not have evolved defenses against these pathogens. This can lead to widespread disease outbreaks, further impacting forest health.
            <br>6. <b>Impact on Wildlife</b>: Changes in plant composition can affect the availability of food and habitat for native wildlife. Invasive species may not provide the same resources as native plants, leading to declines in populations of animals that depend on them.
            <br><br>Efforts to control and manage invasive species are crucial for maintaining the health and sustainability of forest ecosystems. This includes early detection, rapid response measures, and the development of strategies to restore and rehabilitate affected areas.
