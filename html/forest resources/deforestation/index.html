        <p><h4>Deforestation - Solutuons To Clearing of Forests</h4>
            by <i>Malay, Saroj, Mohd Huzaifa</i>
            <p>With the world growing at a pace hard to match, the incresing need for space is turning out to be an area of concern. with a desparate need for land for agricultural, industrial and most importantly, urban requirements to contain cities and their <a href="https://www.prb.org/resources/population-growth-and-deforestation-a-critical-and-complex-relationship/">growing population</a>, a direct action tha we have come to recognize as "Deforestation" occurs.
                <p>Deforestation, in simple terms, means the felling and clearing of forest cover or tree plantations to accommodate agricultural, industrial or urban use. It involves the permanent end of forest cover to make that land available for residential, commercial or industrial purposes.

                        <br><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation">According to Wikipedia</a>:
                        <br>“Deforestation, clearance, clearcutting or clearing is the removal of a forest or stand of trees from land which is then converted to a non-forest use. Deforestation can involve conversion of forest land to farms, ranches, or urban use. The most concentrated deforestation occurs in <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/Deforestation/tropical_deforestation_2001.pdf">tropical rainforests</a>.”
                        <p>Over the last century, the forest cover around the globe has been significantly compromised, leaving the green cover down to an all-time low of about 30 percent. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), an estimated 18 million acres (7.3 million hectares) of forest are lost each year.
                            <br>Deforestation can also be seen as removal of forests leading to several imbalances, both ecologically and environmentally. What makes deforestation alarming is the immediate and long term effects it is bound to inflict if continued at the current pace. Some predictions state that the <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/rain-forest/">rainforests</a> of the world will be eradicated if deforestation continues at its current pace.

                            <div class="point"><b><p><u>Primary Causes of Deforestation</u></b></div>
                                <p>1. <b>Agricultural Activities</b>
                                <br>As earlier mentioned in the overview, agricultural activities are one of the significant factors affecting deforestation. According to the <a href="https://www.fao.org/home/en/">FAO</a>, agriculture leads to around 80% of deforestation. 
                                <br><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=agricultural+activities+cause+deforestation&sca_esv=580562456&rlz=1C1VDKB_enIN1075IN1075&tbm=isch&sxsrf=AM9HkKlNjnovs00DwQMqi05OqUWbhoDDFw:1699471448537&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjsyPu_kLWCAxWnSmwGHcMkDPoQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&cshid=1699471562341603&biw=1536&bih=707&dpr=1.25"><img src="https://theecologist.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline_l/public/2019-09/soybeans-1543071_1280.jpg?itok=JaWP7LQh"></a>
                                <br>Due to the overgrowing demand for food products, a huge amount of trees are felled to grow crops, and 33% of agriculture-caused deforestation is because of subsistence agriculture.<a href="https://sentientmedia.org/how-does-agriculture-cause-deforestation/#:~:text=How%20Does%20Animal%20Agriculture%20Cause,of%20forests%20for%20animal%20grazing.">Click here for more details</a>
                                <p>2. <b>Livestock Ranching</b>
                                    <br>Livestock is believed to be responsible for about 14% of global deforestation. Farmers often clear the land by cutting down trees and burning them to raise livestock and grow food. They continue to use the property until the soil is completely degraded and repeat the same process on new woodland.
                                    <br><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=livestock+ranching&sca_esv=580562456&rlz=1C1VDKB_enIN1075IN1075&tbm=isch&sxsrf=AM9HkKk4mFMq02Qnnd6nYg_XtoJ76BRmyQ:1699472280366&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwibqc7Mk7WCAxVcd2wGHeQ_CKAQ_AUoAXoECAIQAw&biw=1536&bih=707&dpr=1.25"><img src="https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZAET6OGH4UI6TFQVR4NDFFROAQ.jpg"></a>
                                    <br>Eventually, it’ll reforest, but it will take many years to return to its original condition. Surprisingly, over the past 40 years, the forest area has reduced by almost 40 percent, and during the same period, pasture regions and cattle populations have grown significantly and rapidly.<a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/ranching/">Click here for more details</a>
                                    <p>3. <b>Illegal Logging</b>
                                        <br>Apart from this, wood-based industries like paper, match-sticks, furniture, etc. also need a substantial amount of wood supply. Wood is used as fuel, both directly and indirectly.
                                        <br><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+illegal+logging+affects+the+forest+resources&sca_esv=580988201&rlz=1C1VDKB_enIN1075IN1075&tbm=isch&sxsrf=AM9HkKmcCi98zfree187OdrN0EuM_x-CwA:1699567231964&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjmgIip9beCAxVhSGwGHdX6CQkQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=1536&bih=707&dpr=1.25"><img src="https://www.amlrightsource.com/hubfs/Illegal%20logging%20and%20deforestation-%20money%20does%20grow%20on%20trees.jpeg"></a>
                                        <br>Therefore trees are chopped for meeting the demand for supplies. Firewood and charcoal are examples of wood being used as fuel. Some of these industries thrive on illegal wood cutting and felling of trees.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_logging">Click here for more details</a>
                                        <p>4. <b>Urbanization</b>
                                        <br>Further, to gain access to these forests, the construction of roads is undertaken; here again, trees are chopped to build roads.
                                        <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+urbanizATION+IS+affecting+the+forest+resources&sca_esv=580988201&rlz=1C1VDKB_enIN1075IN1075&tbm=isch&sxsrf=AM9HkKmfIFoJrSBIMkKKxa93wZGQaT5e8Q:1699566517386&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjQ0KnU8reCAxXDTWwGHTNJCwgQ_AUoAXoECAMQAw&biw=1536&bih=707&dpr=1.25"><br><img src="https://slideplayer.com/9347949/28/images/slide_1.jpg"></a>
                                        <br>Overpopulation too directly affects forest covers, as with the expansion of cities, more land is needed to establish housing and settlements. Therefore forest land is reclaimed.<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/urbanization-major-cause-pollution-pratanu-banerjee/">Click here for details</a>
                                        <p>5. <b>Desertification of Land</b>
                                        <br>Some of the other factors that lead to deforestation are also partly natural and partly anthropogenic, like desertification of land.
                                        <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+desertification+of+land+affects+the+forest+resources&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwjhyNX-8reCAxW7QmwGHWDqCV8Q2-cCegQIABAA&oq=how+desertification+of+land+affects+the+forest+resources&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQA1AAWABg2gloAHAAeACAAZoBiAGaAZIBAzAuMZgBAKoBC2d3cy13aXotaW1nwAEB&sclient=img&ei=DlRNZeGJC7uFseMP4NSn-AU&bih=707&biw=1536&rlz=1C1VDKB_enIN1075IN1075"><br><img src="https://as2.ftcdn.net/v2/jpg/04/13/92/49/1000_F_413924953_hPk9NWc74PnthJKtVkGtpkZR7z5G2C8a.jpg"></a>
                                        <br>It occurs due to land abuse, making it unfit for the growth of trees. Many industries in petrochemicals release their waste into rivers, which results in soil erosion and make it unfit to grow plants and trees.<a href="https://www.iberdrola.com/sustainability/desertification#:~:text=Consequences%20of%20desertification&text=The%20loss%20of%20vegetation%20cover,to%20the%20loss%20of%20aquifers.">Click here for more details...</a>
                                        <p>6. <b>Mining</b>
                                        <br>Oil and coal mining requires a considerable amount of forest land. Apart from this, roads and highways have to be built to make way for trucks and other equipment.

                                        <p>7. <b>Forest Fires</b>
                                        <br>Another valid example would be forest blazes; hundreds of trees are lost each year due to forest fires in various portions of the world.

                                        <br>It happens due to extreme warm summers and milder winters.

                                        <p>8. <b>Paper</b>
                                        <br>According to the Environment Paper Network, the paper that’s thrown away each year accounts for approximately 640 million trees. America, China, Canada, Japan, constitute more than that of the world’s paper production, and that is 400 million tons a year.
                                        <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+paper+affects+the+forest+resources&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwi7gtqo87eCAxXP6DgGHV8yCsMQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=how+paper+affects+the+forest+resources&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzoECCMQJ1CNPljzXmC2YGgEcAB4BIABoAGIAcgYkgEEMC4yM5gBAKABAaoBC2d3cy13aXotaW1nwAEB&sclient=img&ei=ZlRNZbu3FM_R4-EP3-SomAw&bih=707&biw=1536&rlz=1C1VDKB_enIN1075IN1075"><br><img src="https://naturalenergyhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/paper-recycling-and-solution-for-deforestation-1024x331.png"></a>

                                        <p>9. <b>Overpopulation</b>
                                        <br>The overpopulation requires more land to establish housing and settlements. It generates a significant need for food and farmland to grow food and raise livestock.
                                        <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+overpopulation+affects+the+forest+resources&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwiM5Oq887eCAxUGSGwGHWW8BbAQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=how+overpopulation+affects+the+forest+resources&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQA1ChCVi6PmD1QGgBcAB4AIABqQKIAf8dkgEGMC4xNC43mAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWfAAQE&sclient=img&ei=kFRNZYzcIYaQseMP5fiWgAs&bih=707&biw=1536&rlz=1C1VDKB_enIN1075IN1075"><br><img src="https://ischoolconnect.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Artboard-2.png"></a>
                                        <br>It automatically requires many more roads and highways for transport and communication—all these results in deforestation. Logging industries cut down trees for furniture, paper, building materials, and many more products.
                                        <p>Moreover, the growing human population is directly linked to deforestation. Therefore, it becomes almost essential to purchase from sustainable companies that actively work against deforestation.<a href="https://www.vedantu.com/question-answer/does-population-growth-affect-the-rate-of-defo-class-11-biology-cbse-5ff48089f291a76c57de8c7d">Click here for details...</a>

                                                <p>1. <b>Climate Imbalance and Climate Change</b>
                                                    <br>Deforestation also affects the climate in many ways. Forests are the lungs of our planet. Trees take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen and water vapor in the air, and that is why tropical rainforests are extremely humid.
                                                    <br>Trees also provide shade that keeps the soil moist. All these are compromised with the lack of trees. It leads to the imbalance in the atmospheric temperature, drier climate, further making conditions for the ecology difficult that leads to climate change.
                                                    <p>2. <b>Increase in Global Warming</b>
                                                        <br>Trees play a major role in controlling global warming. The trees utilize greenhouse gases, restoring the balance in the atmosphere. With constant deforestation, the ratio of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has increased, adding to our global warming woes.
                                                        <p>3. <b>Increase in Greenhouse Gas Emissions</b>
                                                            <br>Forests help to mitigate carbon dioxide and other toxic greenhouse gas emissions. However, once they’re cut, burned, or otherwise removed, they become carbon sources.
                                                            <br>It’s estimated that deforestation is responsible for around 20 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and due to tropical deforestation, 1.5 billion tons of carbon is released every year in the atmosphere.
                                                            <p>4. <b>Soil Erosion</b>
                                                                <br>Trees are also crucial for our local water cycles as they keep on returning water vapor to the atmosphere. The soil remains moist as the rainwater percolates within the soil.
                                                                <br>The fertile soil is held in place by intricate root structures of many layers of trees. With the clearance of tree cover, the land is directly exposed to the sun, making it dry. 
                                                                
                                                                Without trees, erosion often occurs and sweeps the land into nearby rivers and streams. Forests serve as nature’s water purification plants. Soil erosion makes soil exposed to contaminants that leach into the water supply, which damages the quality of our drinking water.

                                                        <br>Forests around the world have been home to Indigenous Peoples for tens of thousands of years. Evidence shows that when Indigenous Peoples’ rights to traditional lands and self-determination are respected, forests stay standing. But too often, corporations and governments overlook or intentionally trample the rights of Indigenous Peoples.
                                                        <br><br>For example, the Waswanipi Cree of Northern Quebec are fighting to keep the last wild forests on their traditional land intact, and the Munduruku people of the Amazon are battling a proposed mega-dam that threatens rainforests, a river, and their way of life.

By consuming less, avoiding single-use packaging, eating sustainable food, and choosing recycled or responsibly-produced wood products, we can all be part of the movement to protect forests.
                                                        <br>Make choices for forests, nature, and people — and do so vocally!

                                                        <br>If we’re going to stop deforestation, we need governments to do their part. We need world leaders to embrace ambitious domestic and international forest conservation policies based on the latest science, allowing us to live in a world that avoids severe climate disruption.

                                                        <br>In the United States, laws like the Endangered Species Act, the Wilderness Act, the Lacey Act, and the Roadless Rule help protect our forests and stop illegal wood products from entering the U.S. marketplace. We also support global treaties like the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), Convention on Biological Diversity, and the Framework Convention on Climate Change that have the potential to protect forests and the wildlife that rely on forest habitats.
