        <hr><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>Forests, often refered as the lungs of our planet, are not merely, vast expanses of trees but inticate ecosystem teeming wiith invaluable resources. These forest resources has a wide array of natural assets, each playing a pivotal role in the well-being of both natural and humanity.
            <br>These resources include timber, non-timber forests products (eg. fruits, nuts, medicinal/medicinal plants), wildlife, habitat, clean water, carbon storage and recreational opportunities.

                <br><br>Forest plays a vital role in providing these resources, and their sustainable management is crucial for maintaining ecological balance and meeting human needs.
            <br>"Sustainable forestry practices aim to balance resources extraction with conservation to ensure the long-term health and productivity of forests."
            <h2>FACTORS AFFECTING FORESTS RESOURCES</h2>
            <div class="factors">
            <b><p>Here are some key factors that can affect forests resources:-</b>
                <br><br>> <a href="file:///D:/Onedrive/Desktop/Malay%20codes/HTML/FOREST%20RESOURCES/DEFORESTATION/Index.html"><b>DEFORESTATION</b></a>:- The most significant causes of forets resources depletion is deforestation. This is often driven by activities such as logging, agricultural expansion, infrastructure development and urbanization, which reaults in the removal of trees and destruction of forest ecesystems.
                <br><br>> <a href="file:///D:/Onedrive/Desktop/Malay%20codes/HTML/FOREST%20RESOURCES/CLIMATE/Index.html"><b>CLIMATE CHANGE</b></a>:- Changing climate patterns, including increased temperatures and alternate precipitation patterns, can stress forests.

                <br><br>> <a href="file:///D:/Onedrive/Desktop/Malay%20codes/HTML/FOREST%20RESOURCES/Population.html"><b>GROWING POLLUTION</b></a>:- Pollution from industrial and agricultural sources can contaminate water sources in forests, affecting the health of aquatic ecosystems and availability of clea water resources.
                <br><br>> <a href="file:///D:/Onedrive/Desktop/Malay%20codes/HTML/FOREST%20RESOURCES/Human_Activities.html"><b>HUMAN ACTIVITIES</b></a>:- Activities like unregulated hunting, gathering of non-timber forests products, pressure on forest resources.
                <br><br>> <a href="file:///D:/Onedrive/Desktop/Malay%20codes/HTML/FOREST%20RESOURCES/Invasive.html"><b>INVASIVE SPECIES</b></a>:- The introduction of invasive plant species or pests can disrupt native ecosystems and negatively impact forest resources.
                <br><br>> <a href="file:///D:/Onedrive/Desktop/Malay%20codes/HTML/FOREST%20RESOURCES/policy.html"><b>POLICY AND GOVERNMENT</b></a>:- Weak forest governance, inadequate regulations and ineffective enforcement of environment laws can contribute to resourcesdegradation and deforestation.
