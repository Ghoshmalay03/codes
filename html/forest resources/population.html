    <p><h4>Growing Population</h4>

    <p>1. The growing population has a significant impact on forest resources in several ways. One of the main concerns is deforestation, as increasing population leads to higher demand for land for agriculture, housing, and infrastructure. This often results in the clearing of forests to make way for these developments.
    <p>2. Additionally, the rising population contributes to increased wood consumption for fuel, construction, and other purposes. This can lead to overharvesting of trees, disrupting the balance of ecosystems and depleting forest resources. The need for more land also puts pressure on biodiversity, as it can lead to habitat loss and fragmentation, threatening various plant and animal species.

    <p>3. Population growth also correlates with an uptick in consumption patterns, which can result in more logging, mining, and other resource-extractive activities that negatively impact forests. Sustainable forest management practices become crucial to balance the growing demand for resources with the need to conserve and protect these valuable ecosystems.
